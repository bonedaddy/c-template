  * attribution note: modified version of commander see `deps/commander` for the license for that package
  * to properly use you must load command handlers after constructing the command_object, and prepare the command line inputs for execution
  * this process consists of parsing `argc` and `argv` to determine which command to run, and prepares the input for execution
  * for a propery example see `cli.c`
