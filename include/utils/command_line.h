    cli.h is a basic command line client header file
    You can extend it with additional commands according to your needs.
    Extending with a new command consists of two things:
      * Defining a callback function
      * Defining a function to return a command_handler of your new command
      * Update new_command_object to match the given input against your new command_handl;er
